In order to reform this code in its entirety, you must firstly choose how many parts that you will cut up the input data into,

import numpy as np
from sympy import *
import pickle
from matplotlib import cm
import pandas as pd
import h5py
#I should make 5 codes to calculate
#225GB+
part=0#Change for each file. START FROM 0

tot_parts=8

where tot_parts will break up the input data, and thus you must have that many scripts in order to run the full simulation, where 
each script will have a unique 'part' from 0 to x.
